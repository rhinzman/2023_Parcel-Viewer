### Final Project Proposal
1. The map viewer will serve as a parcel host to view all land record informations
2. Data will be obtained from Delta County Michigan
    Parcel polygon shapefile with all land info is in the attribute table

### The application will serve as a parcel viewer with search bar, zoom in feature, a legend and a basemap. 

1. Persona/Scenario
    1. Persona- Delta County Michigan government officials and county staff, public users interested in parcel information, and private entities using parcel data for business
    2. Scenario- User will be able to open map, search for specific parcel number or ID, access land info associated with parcel ID and zoom to parcels
2. Requirements Document
    1. Representation- Aiming for a simple, intuitive (where forming the overall goal, then a specific intention, and then a specific action to execute is smooth) web page with map taking up ~2/3 of the page and search bar/search results taking up ~1/3 of the page. Search results should be in a format that is useful to government officials and county staff, and that could be easily copied and pasted to an external database.
    2. Interaction- Main actions taken by the user will be using the search feature, zooming and panning to different results, and interpreting those results (percieving state of the system and interpreting state of the system). This will be a smooth loop that the user can seamlessly complete as many times as is necessary to reach their goal of collecting desired information.
